# VNC-Browser 
A Lightweight Web Browsing Environment in Docker with VNC Access

> [!WARNING]  
> This is a fork of [MRColorR/vnc-browser](https://github.com/MRColorR/vnc-browser). The README below is from the original project. I haven't updated it yet. Due to the changes I made this readme is partially irrelevant.
>
> **Changes in this fork:**
> - removed noVNC
> - removed fluxbox
> - removed bash
> - added a bunch of fonts (maybe too much?)
> - the container is not privileged anymore
>
> **Why?**
>
> I need this to serve a single-page dashboard over regular VNC.
> The user won't need any navigation.
> Hence the removal of noVNC and the window manager.
